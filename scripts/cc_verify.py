"""Check a claim's citations against reality, so a confident answer can be refused on arithmetic.

The gate cannot judge whether an answer is *good*. It can judge whether the evidence offered for it
survives being looked up, which is the failure this pipeline exists to catch: the model reaches a
plausible conclusion and stops, and nothing downstream distinguishes that from a checked one.

``file_quote`` is the verdict-heavy one, and its comparison rule comes from measurement rather than
taste. In the depth-gate spike the 31B produced five citations: all five correct in content and line
range, only three byte-exact. One was re-indented by four spaces; one silently tidied a genuinely
odd 13-space line in the source to 12. Byte equality would have failed 40 % of *correct* citations,
and a check that cries wolf gets switched off. So content is compared with indentation normalised,
and indentation drift is reported as its own non-fatal verdict -- worth surfacing, because that same
drift is what breaks this model's edits (see LOCAL_AGENT_OPS.md section 7).

The other three verifiers exist because not every claim is about a file:
  * ``command_result`` -- the claim rests on something a command printed, so the command must
    actually appear in the session's evidence with that text in its output;
  * ``log_match`` -- a pattern must be present in a named log;
  * ``absence`` -- the claim is that something does *not* exist, which is the one kind of claim a
    quote cannot support, and the one the model is most tempted to assert.

Every verifier fails closed: an unreadable file, an unparseable citation or a missing evidence
record is UNVERIFIED, never PASS. That is the opposite of the hook convention in
``cc-context-guard.py``, and deliberately so -- a guard that crashes should let work through, while
a verifier that cannot check something must not bless it.
